## User Story
This is an application that has an employee directory created with React JS. Users are able to view the entire directory and have quick access to their information. It also allows the user to sort through the employees from the search bar and filter by name using the carrot.

## Technology Used
React JS
Random User API

## Usage
Start the application by running `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies. 
Then use `npm start` to run the application on the localhost.

## Future Development
* Create a feature where users can input their own employee data. With that feature this application will not rely on randomizing users. This way companies/businesses would be able to use it using their own employee data.
* Be able to filter using the number directory or  as well the DOB directory.
* Create a clickable alphabet filter line (a,b,c,d,e,f ...) where if the user was to click on "a" all employees with that letter starting their name will be displayed.
